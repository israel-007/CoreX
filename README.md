# CoreX - The Ultimate Helper Code Library
CoreX is an open-source project that brings together helper functions, utilities, and snippets across multiple programming languages to help developers solve common problems efficiently.

## About CoreX
CoreX is designed to be a go-to resource for developers looking for reusable and well-optimized helper functions. Initially, we are starting with PHP, but we plan to expand into JavaScript, Python, Java, and more as the project grows.

## Why CoreX?
* Speeds up development by providing pre-written, well-tested helper functions.
* Encourages collaboration, allowing developers to contribute useful utilities.
* Cross-language support, making it easy to find equivalent functions across different programming languages.

## What's Inside?
CoreX currently includes PHP helper functions for:
- ✔ String Manipulation
- ✔ Array Helpers
- ✔ Date and Time Utilities
- ✔ File Handling
- ✔ HTTP Requests
- ✔ Security Functions

…and much more!
