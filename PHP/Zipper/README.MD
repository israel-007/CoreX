* Download ZIP files with a custom filename
* Remove ZIP files after use
* Get detailed ZIP file information
* Secure and efficient file handling
* Streams large ZIP files to prevent memory exhaustion

## Usage Example

### Basic Example

```php

<?php
    require_once 'Zipper.php';

    // Create an instance of Zipper
    $zipper = new Zipper('my_archive');

    // Add files
    $zipper->add('folder/file1.jpg');
    $zipper->add('folder/file2.mp4');

    // Create the ZIP file
    echo $zipper->zip();

    // Download the ZIP file
    $zipper->download();
?>

```

## Add an Entire Folder

```php 

<?php
    $zipper = new Zipper('my_folder_backup');

    // Add all files inside a folder (recursively)
    $zipper->addFolder('documents');

    // Create ZIP
    echo $zipper->zip();
?>

```

## Download with a Custom Filename

```php

<?php
    $zipper = new Zipper('project_backup');

    $zipper->add('project/code.php');
    $zipper->add('project/config.json');

    // Create ZIP
    echo $zipper->zip();

    // Download with a custom filename
    $zipper->download('backup.zip');
?>


```

## Get ZIP File Information

```php

<?php
    echo Zipper::info('my_archive.zip');
?>


```

### Example Output:

```bash

    {
    "success": true,
    "zip_file": "my_archive.zip",
    "total_files": 5,
    "zip_size": "10.2 MB",
    "files": [
        {"name": "file1.jpg", "size": "200 KB", "compressed_size": "150 KB"},
        {"name": "file2.mp4", "size": "10 MB", "compressed_size": "8.9 MB"}
    ]
}

```

## Delete a ZIP File

```php

<?php
    $zipper = new Zipper('old_backup');
    echo $zipper->remove();
?>

```

## Why Use This PHP Zipper Class?

This PHP-based ZIP manager provides an efficient, lightweight, and flexible way to handle ZIP file operations without requiring external software.

1. Secure & Reliable
- Uses ZipArchive, PHPâ€™s built-in library, ensuring compatibility and stability.
- Prevents file duplicates and corrupt ZIP issues by handling file locks properly.
- Supports large file streaming, avoiding PHP memory exhaustion.
2. Saves Time & Storage
- On-the-fly compression: Reduces file sizes for optimized storage and transfer speeds.
- Auto-delete feature: Optionally removes ZIPs after download to save disk space.
3. Works Everywhere (No Browser Dependencies)
- Unlike browser-based solutions, this works entirely on the server.
- Does not rely on JavaScript, cookies, or local storage.
- Supports Incognito Mode and cross-device access.
4. Optimized for Large Files
- Uses chunk-based streaming for downloading ZIP files.
- Prevents timeout issues when handling large ZIP archives.
5. Great for Web Applications
- Backup and restore file systems
- Download multiple files as a single ZIP
- Store and archive user uploads
- Export database reports as ZIP archives
